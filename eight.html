 <h1>
    Society suffers most not just from the noise of the ignorant, but from the silence of the wise."

Note:
* A healthy society thrives on truth, knowledge, and responsible speech. 

* However, two types of people can cause its downfall. 

* The 1st is the one who knows the truth but chooses to remain silent, either out of fear, indifference, or self-interest.

* Their silence allows ignorance, injustice, and corruption to flourish unchecked. 

* The 2nd is the one who speaks without knowledge, spreading misinformation, confusion, and division.
 
* Their words, though empty of truth, have the power to mislead and manipulate, often shaping public perception and policy in harmful ways.

For progress to prevail, 
* wisdom must find a voice, and ignorance must learn to listen.

* Silence in the face of falsehood is complicity, and speaking without understanding is recklessness.

* Only when the knowledgeable speak with courage and the uninformed seek wisdom with humility can society truly move forward.
